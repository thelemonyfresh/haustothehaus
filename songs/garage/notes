###### NOTES ######
use_bpm 130

# garage_door -> car -> entourage -> keys -> gravel_bd -> all out to just keys/car/sub fades in

# take out the bass drum to introduce the bassline, breakdown into melodies
# transitions should be one element at a time, major things take up to 16 bars
# unfold the melody a few notes at a time_warp
# other songs have a more regular dropped kick drum in an obvious place


# let the grooves sink in a bit more, only a gradual change at a time, c.f. want you forever carl cox
# better use of repeating initialism of sample, end part of sample later
# off-beat melody part is more what I'm going for...
